/**
 * Offline checks for the egress lane's failover ladder (src/egress.js).
 *
 * The outlet here is a CONNECT proxy the test switches between "carries the
 * tunnel" and three ways of failing, and the gateway is an echo server on
 * loopback — so every rung is driven end to end, through the real relay, with no
 * network and no mihomo. What is being pinned:
 *
 *   - a request the outlet could not carry comes back answered, not lost: the
 *     tunnel never opened, the gateway never saw it, so it is replayed once over
 *     the direct path while the strike is recorded;
 *   - one strike asks the host for another node, a benchful of them takes the
 *     outlet out of the path entirely, and the bench window doubles per failed
 *     trial until it settles on the cap;
 *   - the repaired outlet is picked up on the next trial request and the whole
 *     ladder — strikes, bench, doubling — is cleared by the first answer that
 *     comes back through the relay;
 *   - what must *not* count: a caller that walked away, and a body that was
 *     already consumed by the attempt that failed;
 *   - what must not be re-sent even though it counts: a failure that landed
 *     after the request had been handed to the tunnel, which may have been
 *     served upstream.
